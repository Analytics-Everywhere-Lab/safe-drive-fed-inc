Move folders 'images' and 'labels' into dataset and run 1 to 4

1. Sort Classes: 
- Separate the files in sorted dataset into respective images and labels subfolders
- Keeps them in sorted dataset

2. Create Rounds: 
- Converts the dataset into a dataset with incremental rounds 
- Saves the dataset as sorted dataset

3. Filter Labels:  
- In an incremental round, ensure only the valid labels are included for the round
- Manually changes the code for round_{} in the sorted dataset

4. Train Test Split
- Splits each round folder into its train, test, val
- Moves the rounds to the client{i}/incremental_dataset
- Cleans up the folder



For the new v2 data, the labels have been mixed up in Roboflow. Fix the labels using check_labels.ipynb before running 1 to 5. 
Can check using the draw bounding boxes before moving to the client
