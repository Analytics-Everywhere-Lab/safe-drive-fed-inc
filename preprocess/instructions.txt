1. Sort Classes: 
- Separate the files in sorted dataset into respective images and labels subfolders
- Keeps them in sorted dataset

2. Create Rounds: 
- Converts the dataset into a dataset with incremental rounds 
- Saves the dataset as sorted dataset

3. Filter Labels: 
- In an incremental round, ensure only the valid labels are included for the round
- Manually changes the code for round_{} in the sorted dataset

4. Train Test Split

5. Manually move the rounds into the client incremental dataset (to be automated)

6. Clean up sorted_dataset
